# ðŸš¦ Traffic Congestion Predictor

This project presents a machine learning-based system to classify traffic congestion levels (Low, Medium, High) using zone-wise and environmental data. The model was developed as part of an AICTE internship project and aims to support smarter urban traffic planning.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict traffic congestion levels using machine learning
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 100% (after target binning and preprocessing)
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Total Records:** 1440
- **Features Used:**
  - Zone number
  - Temperature
  - Weather (one-hot encoded)
  - Derived Hour (Zone % 24)
- **Target:** Traffic (binned into 3 levels: Low, Medium, High)

---

## ðŸ”§ System Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Dropped unnecessary columns, handled encoding
2. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Created new Hour feature
3. **Target Binning** â€“ Original 1â€“5 levels binned to 3 categories
4. **Model Training** â€“ Random Forest with 80/20 split
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix
6. **Visualization** â€“ Feature importance, zone-wise traffic plot

---

## ðŸ§  Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** `100%` on the test dataset
- **Visual Outputs:**
  - Confusion Matrix (Perfect classification)
  - Feature Importance (Zone and Temperature ranked highest)
  - Boxplots and bar charts showing traffic distribution

---



## ðŸš€ Future Scope

- Integrate live traffic and weather APIs
- Expand dataset to include multiple cities or dynamic zones
- Use advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Deploy as a web app or dashboard (Streamlit/Flask)
- Explore edge deployment for IoT-based traffic sensors
